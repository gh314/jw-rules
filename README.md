# The Jehovah's Witnesses Rulebook
A compilation of the rules on life and ministry of Jehovah's Witnesses.

## Purpose
This project is a community-led compilation of the rules for life and ministry established for members of the Jehovah's Witnesses faith. It's being compiled openly by a community that thinks that these rules, which encompass public and private areas of life, should be well known, clearly worded and open for cross-examination by members, prospective members and interested people.
